// Prototypes


// Inheritance - enables an object to take on the properties and methods of another object(reusable)
// Prototype is the parent of another object
// When accessing a property or a method on an object, javascript engine walks up the protype chain to find the target member


// Prototypes, once declared both of the x and y variable objects have a parent called 'Objectbase'
// let x ={};
// let y = {};
